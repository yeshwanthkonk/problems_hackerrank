### 1. Compare two linked lists
    The lists are equal only if they have the same number of nodes and corresponding nodes contain the same data.
    You have to complete the int CompareLists(Node* headA, Node* headB) method which takes two arguments - the heads of the two linked lists to compare. 
    You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.
    Compare the two linked lists and return 1 if the lists are equal. Otherwise, return 0. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.
