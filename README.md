### 1. Compare two linked lists
    The lists are equal only if they have the same number of nodes and corresponding nodes contain the same data.
    You have to complete the int CompareLists(Node* headA, Node* headB) method which takes two arguments - the heads of the two linked lists to compare. 
    You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.
    Compare the two linked lists and return 1 if the lists are equal. Otherwise, return 0. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.
    
### 2. Staircase
    Consider a staircase of size : 4
    #
    ##
    ###
    ####
    
### 3. Reverse Linked List
    You have to complete the SinglyLinkedListNode reverse(SinglyLinkedListNode head) method which takes one argument - the head of the linked list. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.
    Explanation
    The initial linked list is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
    The reversed linked list is: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
    
### 4. Find_Runner-Up_Score
    Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given  scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.
    Explanation 0
    Given list is 2 3 6 6 5. The maximum score is 6, second maximum is 5. Hence, we print 5 as the runner-up score.
    
### 5. Nested List
    Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.
    Explanation 0
    There are  students in this class whose names and grades are assembled to build the following list:
    python students = [['Harry', 37.21], ['Berry', 37.21], ['Tina', 37.2], ['Akriti', 41], ['Harsh', 39]]
    The lowest grade of 37.2 belongs to Tina. The second lowest grade of 37.21 belongs to both Harry and Berry, so we order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.
